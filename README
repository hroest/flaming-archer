--     OpenMS library       --
------------------------------


This directory contains the sources of OpenMS.

In order to build OpenMS, execute the following commands:
1) autoconf
2) ./configure (see "./configure --help" for options)
3) make

NOTE:
OpenMS depends on the following libraries: CGAL, GSL, Boost, netCDF, ANDI/MS, and QT.
If you need to build them, consider using the contrib package. It contains all needed
libraries except QT and a build mechanism to build them in one step.
You should put the contrib libraries in OpenMS/contrib/, then the configure will find
them automatically. If you cannot place the libraries there, use the configure option
--with-default-path to point configure to the location of the needed libraries.
