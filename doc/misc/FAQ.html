<H1>FAQ</H1>

<OL>

	<h3><LI> After adding a class or after a CVS update, a 'undefined reference' error occurs during execution of programs.</h3>
	
	Deleting the files <tt>libOpenMS.objects</tt> and <tt>libOpenMS_GUI.objects</tt> in the <tt>source</tt> folder 
	will reset the files that are added to the library.

	<h3><LI> After a CVS update, a 'No rule to make target' error occurs during 'make'.</h3>
	
	Try 'make depend' in order to get the dependencies right!

	<h3><LI> Can I use QT designer to create GUI widgets?</h3>
	
	Yes! If you want to create a class called 'Widget':
	<UL>
		<LI> Create .ui-File with QT designer and store it as <tt>Widget.ui</tt>. The main widget has to be called <tt>WidgetTemplate</tt>.
		<LI> Add the class to the <tt>Makefile</tt> (<tt>Widget.C</tt>, <tt>Widget_moc.C</tt>, <tt>WidgetTemplate.C</tt>, 
				 <tt>WidgetTemplate_moc.C</tt>). Use LayerItem as an example which changes are needed.
		<LI> From the .ui-File the files <tt>source/VISUAL/ClassTemplate.C</tt> and 
		     <tt>include/OpenMS/VISUAL/UIC/ClassTemplate.h</tt> are created by the build system when you execute 
		     <tt>'make depend'</tt> and <tt>'make'</tt>.<BR>DO NOT CHECK IN THESE FILES, AS THEY ARE GENERATED 
		     AUTOMATICALLY, WHEN NEEDED!!!
		<LI> Derive the class <tt>Widget</tt> from <tt>WidgetTemplate</tt> and use overloading to define the underlying 
		     behaviour. You need to check in the <tt>Widget.h</tt> and <tt>Widget.C</tt> files.
	</UL>
	
	<h3><LI> How do I debug uncaught exceptions?</h3>
	
	There is a mechanism to have a core dumped if an uncaught exception occurs.<BR>
	To enable it, the environment variable OPENMS_DUMP_CORE has to be set.<BR>
	Each time an uncaught exception occures, the OPENMS_DUMP_CORE variable is checked and a segmentation fault is caused, if it is set.
	
	<h3><LI> Why is no core dumped, although a fatal error occured?</h3>
	
	Try the 'ulimit -c unlimited' command. It sets the maximum size of a core to unlimited.<BR>
	<br>
	<i>Note: </i> We observed that, on some systems, no core is dumped even if the size of the
	core file is set to unlimited. We are not sure what causes this problem.

	<h3><LI> How can I set breakpoints in 'gdb' to debug OpenMS?</h3>
	
	Let's say you want to debug the 'TOPPView' application and you want it to stop at line 341 of 'SpectrumMDIWindow.C'.
	<BR>
	<OL>
		<LI>Run gdb:
			<BR>
			<tt>shell&gt; gdb TOPPView</tt>
		<LI>Start the application (and close it):
			<BR>
			<tt>gdb&gt; run [arguments] </tt>
		<LI>Set the breakpoint:
			<BR>
			<tt>gdb&gt; break SpectrumMDIWindow.C:341</tt>
		<LI>Start the application again (with the same arguments):
			<BR>
			<tt>gdb&gt; run</tt>
	</OL>
	
	<h3><LI> How do I add a new directory in the <tt>source/</tt> directory to the built system?</H3>
	
	Add the new directory name to the end of the '<tt>SUBDIRS</tt>' variable in <tt>source/configure.ac</tt>.

	<h3><LI> After compiling OpenMS successfully, I receive a linker error saying something about
	<tt>QString:QString(std::char...)</tt> </H3>
	
	Try compiling OpenMS with the multithread version of QT by running configure with the option
	--with-qt-mt .
