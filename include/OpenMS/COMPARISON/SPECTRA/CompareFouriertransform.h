  /**
      @brief Compare Discrete Cosines value from a Fourier transformation, also known as Discrete Cosines Transformation

      The Direct Cosines Transformation based on the theory of the Fourier transformation.
      In this class the Fast Fourier Transformation(FFT) algorithm of the gsl library is used. FFT has a run-time complexity of
      n (log n). To get the Direct Cosines Transformation from a FFT there is preparation necessary. First the
      input data has to be mirrored. This is necessary, because FFT needs data which has a periodic nature.
      After the computation of FFT only the cosine values are important and stored in the Meta Data Array. So an inverse transformation of these values
      to get the original spectrum is not available.
      The comparison is done between two Meta Data Arrays, which contain the stored cosine values of their individual spectrum.
      The advantage of this method is how the comparison works. There is only one sum which has to be count, no multiplication is needed.

      Attention: only use the compare function, if the Spectrum was transformed earlier, else an error is going to appear.
      Only use this method of transformation, if you are sure there exists enough free memory. This is a fast estimation, but it only gives one or
      zero back.
